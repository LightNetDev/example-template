## 🚀 Getting started

To create a **local copy**, run the following from your terminal:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template LightNetDev/example-template
```

**💡 Tip:** Look for the `TODO` comments in the code — they’ll walk you through the first steps of setting things up and making it your own.

## 📦 Project commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| `npm run dev`     | Start the local development server at `localhost:4321` |
| `npm run build`   | Build the production site to the `./dist/` folder      |
